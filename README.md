# Minesweeper

Welcome to Minesweeper! My own implementation of such a [classic game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minesweeper_(video_game)) using Java.


### Running

You can use Java 8 to run the application, and JDK 8 is required to compile it. The suggested way to build is using Maven. Here's an example:

First, get the source files (must have git already installed)
```
$ git clone https://github.com/agudelotmateo/minesweeper.git
$ cd minesweeper
```

Now build
```
$ mvn package
```

Finally, you can execute it by running
```
$ java -cp target/minesweeper-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar com.agudelotmateo.minesweeper.App
```


### Usage

Follow the on-screen instructions and you should not have any problem. Have fun!
